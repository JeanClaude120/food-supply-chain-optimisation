# Optimising Food Supply Chains: A Data-Driven Approach to Reducing Waste and Improving Efficiency

This project uses a simulated dataset to explore how data analytics can be applied to food supply chains, focusing on warehouse and distribution centre operations. It demonstrates how inefficiencies can be identified and waste reduced through exploratory data analysis, clustering, and predictive modelling.

# Project Highlights
- Simulated dataset with 200 warehouse records across the UK
- Exploratory analysis of storage, dispatch, spoilage, and cost data
- Clustering of warehouses based on performance metrics
- Regression model to predict food spoilage
- Visual insights for logistics optimisation
